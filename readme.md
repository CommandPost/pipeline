# Pipeline

Pipeline is a Swift framework for working with FCPXML files easily.

## About
Pipeline is used mostly through the XMLDocument and XMLElement classes from the Foundation library. Through Swift extensions, Pipeline adds onto those classes and allows you to work with the XML file easily in an object-oriented way without managing the XML itself.
